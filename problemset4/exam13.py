"""Task 13
Write a Python program that reads 5 numbers into a list and prints the smallest and largest number and their locations in the list. [You are not allowed to use the max(), min(), sort(), sorted() functions here]

Hint: You may assume the first input to be the largest value initially and the largest valueâ€™s location to be 0. Similarly, you can assume the first input to be the smallest value initially and the smallest valueâ€™s location to be 0.

Note: You may need to be careful while printing the output. Depending on your code, you might need data conversion.

Sample Input:
7, 13, -5, 10, 6

Sample Output:
My list: [7, 13, -5, 10, 6]
Smallest number in the list is -5 which was found at index 2
Largest number in the list is 13 which was found at index 1"""

l = input().split(",")
l_1 = []
lar_num = 0
index_num = 0
small_num = 0
index_num_1 = 0

for i in l:
    l_1.append(int(i))

small_num = int(l[0])
for j in range(len(l_1)):
    if l_1[j] > lar_num:
        lar_num = l_1[j]
        index_num_1 = j
    if l_1[j] < small_num:
        small_num = l_1[j]
        index_num = j
print("My list: ", l_1)
print("Largest number in list is ", lar_num, "which was found at index ", index_num_1)
print("Smallest number in list is ", small_num, "which was found at index ", index_num)
